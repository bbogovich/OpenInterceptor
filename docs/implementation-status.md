# Implementation status

Updated as each stage progresses. Stage pages hold the detail; this page is the summary.

| Stage | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [0 Foundation](implementation-plan/stage-0-foundation.md) | **Done** | Repository, SpecItOut manifest, gate, docs site; every asset type for stages 1–2 decoded and verified |
| [1 Flight simulator](implementation-plan/stage-1-flight.md) | **Done** — signed off by the developer's playtest on 2026-11-10 (build 0.2.1) | See the checklist below |
| [2 Combat, objects and behaviours](implementation-plan/stage-2-combat.md) | **In progress** — build **0.2.2** (deliveries of 2026-11-10) | See [Stage 2 progress](#stage-2-progress) below |

## Stage 0 results

- All **297** XMSH meshes in `xobjects1.dll` and `xobjects2.dll` parse, with 4 LODs each.
- The three player hulls and an alien saucer were rendered with their original textures by an
  independent prototype decoder, confirming the mesh, UV and texture layouts.
- XTXR textures (all sizes), cockpit TGAs (colour key), ADPCM sound effects and PCM music loops
  are understood. Balance data is plain INI.
- Unknowns that do not block stages 1–2: XSPT RLE details, a few mesh fields, the MFD animation
  file `mfdanim.mps`, the AIFF-C codec of the extracted CD audio.

## Stage 1 checklist

Code as of main `bcd7706` (app build 0.2.1). "Done" = built, unit-tested and seen working against the reference
CD on macOS. **Signed off** by the developer's playtest on 2026-11-10; open items below
(Linux run, physical gamepad) carry over as manual tests.

### Verified visually during development (macOS, reference CD)

Cockpit A view with radar contacts, gauges and MFD; chase views of the Lightning II and Super
Avenger (model orientation and engine glow); targeting with brackets, lead circle, lock ring,
"MISSILE LOCK" and the target MFD; throttle to 100 % and over 500 m/s, yaw; beams firing with
energy drain; the launcher with ship preview; cockpit C in `combat-test` under hostile fire;
`sample-arena` with no original data; the model viewer. After build 0.2.0's changes: a 2560×1920
HD repaint of cockpit A overriding the original in game (MT-1-25); `--extract` over the whole CD
(MT-1-27). Not yet seen after the changes: newtonian flight on screen, the 3D cockpit, the asset
browser, the app opened from Finder (the screen locked during development).

Build 0.2.1 fixes playtest reports against 0.2.0: original meshes had stretched or missing
textures (clamped instead of tiled UVs), flicker on stations, saucers, shields and the Avenger fin
(no back-face culling; coplanar decals), weapon streaks that seemed to start behind the ship in
chase view, and radar scopes offset from cockpit A's art. Seen fixed in the model viewer
(XBASE7, CPAT, ROID100, ALIENC7, AVENGER16) and in cockpit A (`combat-test`).
